I am a Research Scientist working on AI infra at
[Meta](https://www.meta.com/about/). During my PhD, my research
interests span broadly in the area of
[systems](https://www.usenix.org/publications/login-logout/november-2013-login-logout/night-watch)
and
[networking](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~lixia/papers/SIG2020-Talk-Lixia.pdf#page=39),
with a focus on building large scale distributed storage systems. Right
now, I work on problems related to systems and infrastructure for AI.

I completed my Ph.D. from [Khoury
College](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at
[Northeastern](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in Oct 2025 and was
advised by [Peter Desnoyers](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/pjd/).  My
dissertation, "[Towards an Efficient and Strongly-consistent Distributed
Object Store](/assets/pdf/sun2025_dissertation.pdf)", focused on the
efficiency problem in distributed storage systems by introducing **I/O
amplification** as a key metric to measure storage system efficiency
(the ratio of total device I/O to client-requested I/O). In the
dissertation, I then present ZStore, an efficiency-first distributed
object store that achieves **minimal I/O operations**: one NVMe read per
GET request and k writes per PUT request under k-way replication. 

Prior to Northeastern, I earned my M.S. (2017) in Computer Science from
Boston University under the supervision of Prof. Orran Krieger and was
affiliated to [Mass Open Cloud (MOC)](https://massopen.cloud/). During which my research revolved
around performance diagnosis for distributed systems and datacenter
networking. I also received a B.Eng. (2015) in Software Engineering from
Sun Yat-sen University.
