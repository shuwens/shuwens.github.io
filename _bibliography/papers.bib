abstract = {S3-compatible object storage has become ubiquitous, used by an
ever-expanding range of applications. Workload traces show that
many of these applications treat object storage like a traditional
file system, with many small reads and writes, yet object storage
implementations have not kept up. Optimized for bulk storage,
these systems cannot efficiently exploit modern SSDs, requiring
large hardware installations to achieve operation rates typical of
local file systems on modest machines.
ZStore is a highly-efficient object store designed for modern
hardware, providing strong consistency (per-key linearizability) via
a novel architecture which replicates data over independent per-
device shared logs, using NVMe-over-Fabrics as its backend storage
protocol. Based on a 3-node symmetric active-active cell, ZStore
performs small reads and writes with minimal I/O amplification
(beyond replication factor) while supporting object sizes up to the
S3 maximum of 5 TB and optional erasure coding for objects larger
than 128 KB. ZStore guarantees single-key linearizability using a
two-phase coordination mechanism, tracking in-flight writes so
that reads of stable data can be handled on a single gateway, with
a heavier-weight multi-node read protocol used only when inter-
fering writes are detected. Our evaluation shows ZStore achieving
nearly an order of magnitude improvement in IOPS over widely-
used systems (MinIO and Ceph) when evaluated on comparable
hardware.},
